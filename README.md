# FashionMNIST
This repository contains the code for my Fashion MNIST Classification project. In this project, I have implemented different neural network architectures. I have implemented one Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN) and two different Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to classify images of fashion items into 10 different categories.
